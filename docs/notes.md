# Enhance data

Book data is stored inn `booklist.csv`

Creates or updates booklist.csv.
The mail notices include data for date,author,title,subtitle.  These are parsed by `parse_checkouts` and merged with existing records.

The data is enhanced by `search.py` to include the isbn,callno,cover fields.

Titles and check-out dates are assumed correct and are used to determine whether to add new records (together they are unique).
Other fields may be amended in booklist.csv and they will be carried forward upon update.

Work flow is 

1. put latest updated booklist in data/
1. bring emails into /data/maildrop
1. run parse_checkout
1. run search

At that point the booklist and data/covers/ have been updated

# to do

1. Is there someway to capture the library to go with the call number?
2. In search there are places (or maybe just one) where we take the first of a list (is there something better?)
3. Pull data from reading history as alternative to email.




## Data sources

## items from checkout emails

Some authors truncated.
Several have co-authors or 'written and illustrated by' or just 'by'

## LCI

https://lci-mt.iii.com/iii/encore/search/C__St%3A%28Where%20water%20meets%20land%29%20c%3A29__Lf%3Afacetcollections%3A29%3A29%3ASouthWindsor%3A%3A__Orightresult__U?lang=eng&suite=cobalt

That's encoded version of

https://lci-mt.iii.com/iii/encore/search/C__St:(Where water meets land) c:29__Lf:facetcollections:29:29:SouthWindsor::__Orightresult__U?lang=eng&suite=cobalt

Some records don't have isbns (too old) or even though they may exist.

## ISBN

International Standard Book Number - only used since about 1970.

This site seems to be open and provides covers

Direct get gets a recapchta

This site seems easier

https://www.biblio.com

## Search

Working ok with both author and title. 

& has to be escaped in shell as \&

### Unicode
le carr√© works the same as le carre on the LCI search


### Without author
Nobel got 21 hits then fails on unbound isbns. LCI does not list and isbn of first book (which is the right one)
Fixed by detecting an exiting.

But 'the last theorem' worked fine with no author

### Biblio alt page

'silverview' got 4 hits then fails on NoneType when biblio returns different page format

### 429

Had to implement retry to support 429 at biblio.

# Output

Had to store ibsns in output as '="<ibsn>"' to stop excel from converting to numbers
